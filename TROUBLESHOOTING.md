# Troubleshooting

## No property page, or does not work

1. 32-bit Windows is not supported.
2. If you can see the property page, open the device list; if your device is listed multiple times, you usually want the first one, but try every entry.
3. Try fully quitting the StreamDeck software and re-opening it. To fully quit, right click on the system tray icon, and select "Quit Stream Deck".
4. Check your anti-virus or other anti-malware history to make sure it has not modified it.
5. Try removing the action/icon and re-adding it.
6. Try uninstalling and re-installing the plugin. If this fixes the issue, check your anti-virus/anti-malware software again.
